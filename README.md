# CARS-DATASET

Comprehensive Analysis of Car Specifications and Trends Dataset
This project involves an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing various specifications and features of different car models. The analysis aims to uncover insights and trends in the automobile industry, focusing on key parameters such as engine performance, fuel efficiency, pricing, and other critical attributes.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends across various car features using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Trend Analysis: Identifying patterns in pricing, engine types, fuel efficiency, and more, to understand how these have evolved over time.
Data Visualization: Creating clear and informative visualizations to represent the findings, aiding in better comprehension of the data.
